# CommunityVuln_PlosOne
Code to accompany manuscript on Fishing Community Vulnerability by Koehn et al. 2022 in journal Plos ONE

Much of the relevant data are within the manuscript and its Supporting Information
files, including values calculated in this paper such as ecological sensitivity, exposure,
risk, and community exposure, sensitivity, adaptive capacity, and vulnerability.
Additionally, summarized data needed to calculate community exposure, sensitivity,
adaptive capacity, and vulnerability will be provided along with R code at the time of
publication at https://github.com/koehnl/CommunityVuln_PlosOne

Certain data underlying the above values presented in the study are publicly available.
Specifically, through Aquamaps: https://www.aquamaps.org/ for species ranges to
determine ecological risk or by contacting Aquamaps at info.aquamaps@gmail.com.
Additional raster files needed to construct species range files are available here
through the github page cited in this paper: O'hara CC, Afflerbach JC, Scarborough C,
Kaschner K, Halpern BS. Aligning marine species range data to better serve science
and conservation. PLoS One. 2017 May 3;12(5):e0175739.
https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0175739 and at the associated git repository
https://github.com/OHI-Science/IUCN-AquaMaps (and as part of the code to rasterize
species range data available at the time of publication on github here:
https://github.com/koehnl/CommunityVuln_PlosOne). Social metric data for calculating adaptive
capacity for communities are available through the CDC here:
https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/placeandhealth/svi/data_documentation_download.html

The summarized tables of climate variables experienced by species in their ranges
(output from the climate models), needed to calculate ecological exposure, sensitivity,
and risk, will be available via Dryad (https://datadryad.org/stash) at the time of
acceptance and publication (DOI here). The underlying physical and biogeochemical
variables from the downscaled projections are available upon request from authors
Mike Jacox at NOAA (michael.jacox@noaa.gov) or Jerome Fiechter at UC Santa Cruz
(fiechter@ucsc.edu).

Confidential vessel-level landings data may be acquired by direct request from the
Pacific Fisheries Information Network (PacFIN) (https://pacfin.psmfc.org/) or the
Departments of Fish and Wildlife in California, Oregon, and Washington, subject to a
non-disclosure agreement. R code to summarize PacFIN data as done for this paper is availabile on this github. 

Values for community reliance (from NOAA California Current Integrated Ecosystem
Assessment) will be provided in the same Dryad repository at the time of publication.
